Regs directory contains following files:


DeleteDatabaseFile - Allow.reg:
DeleteDatabaseFile - Disallow.reg:

Normally when a database is deleted in Databases settings tab, Locate32 will ask if 
you want to also delete the actual database file. If you want to prevent this, 
merge the "DeleteDatabaseFile - Disallow.reg" registry patch. Merge 
"DeleteDatabaseFile - Allow.reg" to restore default this behauviour. 



ResultListDelayTimes.reg:

It is possible that "Stop" and other buttons in Locate dialog does not respond if you use other 
view mode than "Details" in the results list. You can prevent this by merging this registry patch.
You can also modify "WaitEvery30" and "WaitEvery60" values in the registry patch valued to obtain 
the best performance. The value of WaitEvery30 (or WaitEvery60) means that how many millisecons is 
waited after 30 (or 60) items are added to the results list. 



Search protocol - Register.reg
Search protocol - Unregister.reg

In Windows Vista SP1 it's possible to specify default desktop search application using 
"Default programs" (Control Panel). Before you can use Locate32 as the default desktop 
search application, you need to register Locate32 "search:" protocol. This protocol can
be registered/unregistered using these registry patch files.

To make Locate32 as the default desktop search application, do the following:
1. Open "Search protocol - Register.reg" file to text editor (e.g. Notepad) and check
   that Locate32 directory is correct (default is C:\Program Files\Locate).
2. Merge "Search protocol - Register.reg" file by double clicking it 
3. Open "Default Programs", choose "Associate a file type or protocol with a program".
   Find a protocol "SEARCH" and choose "Change Program" (you can also double click the 
   protocol). Choose "Locate32".

Note that when Locate32 is the default desktop search application, you don't need to 
assign Win+F, F3 and Ctrl+F keys (as keyboard hooks) in Locate32 to open Locate32 
dialog using those keys. These keys will open Locate32 dialog even if locate32.exe is 
not running.
